Customer comes in
	first they enter their license plate. will be used to check if in database or not

	they enter their license plate number, name, phone number, email address, address(optional)
	if they are a new customer (license plate is not found in database):
		app does an api call to fill in the rest of their information with VIN lookup
		they are sent to a page asking them to either confirm their information or unconfirm it
		if they unconfirm it:
			they are able to edit the text fields that have been filled in with their own information by tapping the fields
			they can then click submit
			they can then click confirm
			
		
		a new entry will be created with the information in database. (new customer, new vehicle, new order)
		
	if they are actually a returning customer (license plate number and phone/email/name already exists):
		a page will show saying that they already have the customer on file. they will show the license plate and owner and ask user to confirm it is them
		if they confirm:
			app will ask if they want to update whatever fields are different
		if they do not confirm:
			a new entry will be created with the information in database. (new customer, new vehicle, new order)
			
	the app calculates how much the servicing will cost by using the date of the car and whatever deals we are having etc
	the app makes an invoice using an invoice template and sends it to the customer via email


Plan v2:

License plate number is all that needs to be entered. No new and returning. This will do API call.
If license plate is in database, populate user information too. Ask user to verify and let them change user information. 
If license plate isn't in database, make them populate it. They shouldn't be allowed to edit the car stuff.
Email and phone and phone should be mandatory.
Ask how they heard about us (drop down for yelp, google, etc)

Calculate pricing based on car year. Tell them pricing and explanation for why.
